Data File

Download the payroll.csv Download payroll.csv file and place it in your C# program. The structure of the data in the file is as follows:

first_name,last_name,hours_worked,pay_rate


Program Flow

You program should do the following:

    Ask the user for their name
    Ask the user for the file to be read
    If the user file name provided does not end in ".csv" then your code should add ".csv" to the file name
     Read the data file line by line to get the individual pieces of data
    Calculate the pay for each worker
    Print each employees pay to the console
    Create a summary report named salarySummary.txt contains
        Number of Employees
        Total Payroll
        Average Pay
        Maximum Pay
        Minimum Pay
    Output a message letting the user know the report was successfully written
    End the program

Note: You must write a minimum of five (5) user defined functions. Writing a function to get the user name, or print the success message when the file is written, and the like will not count.
